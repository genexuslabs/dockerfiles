These are the Dockerfiles needed to run GeneXus generated applications.
By default, GeneXus generates a docker-compose file with official images (asp.net, SQLServer, Tomcat) but sometimes an external Dockerfile is needed. This repository will hold those dockerfiles with a little explanation on why are they needed.

 - [.NET Framework](./.net)
 - [.NET Core](./.net%20core)
 - [Java](./java)
