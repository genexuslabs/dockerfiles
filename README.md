# Genexus Dockerfiles

(under construction ðŸš§)

These are the Dockerfiles needed tu run Genexus generated applications.
By default, Genexus generates a docker-compose file with official images (asp.net, SQLServer, Tomcat) but sometimes an external Dockerfile is needed. This repository will hold thos dockerfiles with a little explanation on why are they needed.
